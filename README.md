clone https://github.com/MountCloud/FireDog and get stuck in vscode which always complaining FireDog.h is missing, no matter how I change includepath in vscode
tweak the code structure  org a little bit and add a sample cmake file to make it work with cmake
then it should be able to be easy in vscode.
